# Deploy React & NodeJS to AWS

### üëã Personal note
This is a basic example of deploying an MVP to get up and running.

# Process

### AWS Services
- EC2 - Virtual servers for running applications.
- S3 - Object storage for static files.
- CloudFront - Content delivery network for fast distribution of static files.
- Route 53 - Scalable domain name system for mapping domain names to IP addresses.
- Elastic IPs (EC2) - Static IP addresses for EC2 instances.
- ACM - SSL/TLS certificate management for secure communication over the internet.

### Other Services
- Nginx - Web server for serving dynamic content and managing traffic (our reverse proxy).
- CertBot - SSL certificate management tool for Nginx.
- PM2 - Process manager for Node.js applications.
- GIT.
- Domain provider.


## Front
* Buy a domain from a provider (GoDaddy, Google, etc).
* Connect it to Route 53 with Nameservers.
* Upload React‚Äôs build/dist folder to a new S3.
* Create a CloudFront distribution and request an SSL certificate.

## Back
* Lanuch a new EC2 instance - Amazon Linux 2.
* Set up security group - HTTPS, HTTP, SSH (after testing we will remove HTTP). 
* Create a Route 53 Record for connecting the IP address of the instance to api.mysite.com (Later we will switch it with an elastic ip).
* Connect to instance via SSH.
* Install Node, Git, and PM2.
* Connect GitHub SSH to your EC2, and clone your repo.
* Add a testing route to your server (‚Äò/test‚Äô).
* Install dependencies & create .env file if needed.
* Add CORS to Node application based on your React origin.
* Run pm2 start server.js.
* Test route.

## Finish
* Install Nginx.
* Add proxy pass to nginx.conf.
* Update nginx.conf for the new domain route (api.mysite.com).
* Set up SSL using CertBot.
* Add elastic IP for the instance assosiate it, and  change the record (api.mysite.com).
* Go make some cool shit.


## Security Groups
* HTTP (port 80) - for serving web traffic over HTTP.
* HTTPS (port 443) - for serving web traffic over HTTPS.
* SSH (port 22) - for accessing the EC2 instance via SSH.



# Useful Commands


### NodeJS
Install (Amazon linux 2)

```bash
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
```

```bash
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```

```bash
sudo yum install -y nodejs
```


### Git
Install with yum

```bash
sudo yum install -y git
```



### Nginx

Install (Amazon linux 2)
```bash
sudo dnf install -y nginx
```

###  SSL


```bash
sudo python3 -m venv /opt/certbot/
sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install --upgrade pip

sudo /opt/certbot/bin/pip install certbot certbot-nginx
sudo ln -s /opt/certbot/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

In the HTTP block, add the following lines to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS:


```bash
server {
listen 80;
server_name example.com;
return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx 
```

Commands
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```


Renew SSL (make sure to allow port 80)
```bash
sudo certbot renew
```



### pm2

Commands
```bash
pm2 start server.js 
```

```bash
pm2 kill 
```

```bash
pm2 stop all
```

```bash
pm2 status
```

```bash
pm2 logs
```
