# ⚙️ Process

### AWS Services
- EC2 
- S3 
- CloudFront 
- Route 53 
- Elastic IPs (EC2)
- ACM (for CloudFront SSL)


### Other Services
- Nginx  
- CertBot (Nginx SSL) 
- PM2 
- GIT
- Domain provider



## Front
* Buy a domain.
* Connect it to Route 53 with Nameservers
* Upload React’s build folder to a new S3.
* Create a CloudFront distribution with an SSL certificate.

## Back
* Set up EC2 - Amazon Linux 2.
* Set up security group (https, ssh).
* Create a Route53 Record for connecting the IP address of the instance to api.mysite.com.
* Connect to instance via SSH.
* Download Node, Git, and PM2.
* Connect GitHub SSH to EC2, and clone your repo.
* Add a testing route to your server (‘/test’).
* Install dependencies & create .env file if needed.
* Add CORS to node application based on your react origin.
* Run pm2 start server.js.
* Test route.


## Finish
* Download Nginx.
* Add proxy pass to nginx.conf.
* Test route.
* Update nginx.conf for the new domain route (api.mysite.com).
* Set up SSL using CertBot.
* Add elastic IP for the instance assosiate it, and  change the record (api.mysite.com).
* Test everything.
